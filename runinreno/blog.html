                     <p class="bottom-paragraph">When I was younger I loved to run. I was faster than all of the boys into 7th and 8th grade. My Dad was a runner in college and my older brother also ran. Unfortunately, at the age 14 I started to make poor decisions and started smoking. I smoked heavily for 25 years and didn't take care of myself. Now at 42 I have quit smoking and lost 35 pounds and started to run. I found my passion again and nothing can hold be back. It's not easy, but I can do hard things.</p>
