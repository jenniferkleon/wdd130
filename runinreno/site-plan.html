      <h3>Trails</h3>
      <p>
        SteamBoat Ditch Trail:
        This trail is a wide, dusty, well-worn double track that parallels Steamboat Ditch,
        a seasonally-flowing irrigation ditch that carries water from the Truckee River in Verdi to farms and ranches in South Reno. 

        Reno Truckee River Trail:
        A fun paved urban walk through downtown and along the Truckee River. The trail can be continued in either direction.
        Experience this 3.5-mile out-and-back trail near Reno, Nevada. Generally considered an easy route. This is a very popular area for birding, road biking, and running, so you'll likely encounter other people while exploring.
