    <h3>Your attitude is your paintbrush</h3> 
    <p>Hello class. It is a pleasure to meet you.
     I live in Reno Nevada USA.
     I have been married to my husband for 5 years
     and I have one son Caleb who is 16 years old.
     My husband has 5 grown children.
     I currently work as a nursing assistant  in a local hospital
      while pursuing  a bachelors in applied technology 
     with a focus on databases and programing.</p>
    <p> I have been a member of the church since I was 15.
     I was ex-communicated and spent 10 years away,
     but 3 years ago I was rebaptized. 
     Thanks to the atonement of Jesus Christ,
     everything that took place in those 10 years I was away
      is as if it never happened.
    When I was rebaptized my church records show
     my baptismal  date as September 21, 1995.</p>
    <p> I neglected to mention my cat Mr. Toe,
     whom I am more than a bit obsessed with.
     You will meet him if ever on a zoom meeting with me
     because  he sits with me... wherever I may be.</p>
